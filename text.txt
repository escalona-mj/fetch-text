Update: fetching of text is instant. however, it is not in REAL TIME and a github issue.
Not an issue per se, but rather the nature of updating raw text files coming from a massive network.
default cache is around 5 minutes before it is cleared.

Adding ?token=$(date +%s) updates the raw file temporarily on a browser, but not for the game.

Update: i was mistaken. fetching of text is instant and real time. It probably depends on how much text is added on a file before the raw text is updated.
will have to look on this for another try.

update: added ?token=$(date +%s) to the url. surprisingly, it handles it pretty well.

Update: setting the repository to private makes the file inaccessible in the game. Reason, 404 client error: not found.
adding the randomly generated token from the url after setting the repo to private to the code might fix this, but this might also pose a security vulnerability.
