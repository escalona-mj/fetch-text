Update: fetching of text is instant. however, it is not in REAL TIME and a github issue.
Not an issue per se, but rather the nature of updating raw text files coming from a massive network.
default cache is around 5 minutes before it is cleared.

Adding ?token=$(date +%s) updates the raw file temporarily on a browser, but not for the game.
