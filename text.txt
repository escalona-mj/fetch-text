Update: fetching of text is instant. however, it is not in REAL TIME and a github issue.
Not an issue per se, but rather the nature of updating raw text files coming from a massive network.
default cache is around 5 minutes before it is cleared.

Adding ?token=$(date +%s) updates the raw file temporarily on a browser, but not for the game.

Update: i was mistaken. fetching of text is instant and real time. It probably depends on how much text is added on a file before the raw text is updated.
will have to look on this for another try.
